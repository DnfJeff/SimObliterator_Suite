What this test run really proves

1. Core contract is stable
- Action Registry + Safety API + Mutation Pipeline passing together
- Clear separation: intent -> permission -> execution
- INSPECT / PREVIEW / MUTATE enforcement is real
- High-risk actions are detectable, categorizable, and gateable
- This is the line between a toy editor and a tool safe for real saves
- FreeSO never had to formalize this because it was runtime-only; this does

2. BHAV is no longer a black box
- Executor
- Trace
- Validator
- Importer
- Editor (read-only)
- Global / semi-global / object-local patching
- Full BHAV lifecycle is represented
- Most tools stop at "here's a BHAV dump"
- This enables semantic reasoning, not just byte editing
- BHAV patching + ID remapping + call rewiring loading cleanly is a major stability win

3. Containers are solved
- IFF, FAR, DBPF
- Split / merge
- Reindex
- Normalize
- Write-back
- Safe round-tripping of assets
- Archive restructuring without corruption
- Enables mass fixes, migrations, cross-expansion reconciliation
- This is engine tooling, not a modding UI

4. Save editing is real
- Game file tests validate real persistence
- Mutations tested:
  - Skills
  - Motives
  - Relationships
  - Money
- Changes apply cleanly
- Persistence boundaries are respected
- Loads do not crash
- Results match in-game expectations (e.g. neighbor rebuild behavior)
- Difference between hex-editing and something shippable

5. GUI is a shell by design
- All panels detected, but that’s not the point
- Action mapping exists
- Focus coordination exists
- Headless testing exists
- UI is not the authority
- Engine can support:
  - Full GUI replacement
  - CLI
  - Web frontend
  - Scripting
- Core logic does not care
